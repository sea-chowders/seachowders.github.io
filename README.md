=====================
I used bootstrap3 to help style me website.  I ended up using the readmore plug in (available at : https://github.com/jedfoster/Readmore.js ) to create some interactivity within my resume and projects sections.  I also used the magnifiq plug in (available at : https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup ) to show of some of the design projects I have created over the years in my project sectioin.
